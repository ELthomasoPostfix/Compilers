# Compilers
A project for the course Compilers at the University of Antwerp during the second semester of academic year of 2021-2022. The group is composed of Jeff Boermans and Thomas Gueutal.

# Scripts
The run.sh script should be called to in one step 1) generate the dependency ANTLR python files if they do not exist yet 2) call the main.py file. The script depends on the generate.sh script to generate the dependency ANTLR python files. The generate.sh script can be called individually as well.

# ANTLR runtime
The ANTLR 4 runtime package is provided together with this repository. It is found in the 'Input' directory. As such, all scripts refer to that .jar file instead of any pre-installed versions of ANTLR.
